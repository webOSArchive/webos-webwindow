<h2>Web Window - Help</h2>

<p>Web Window is designed to be a simple app that keeps a single page open, refreshing periodically if configured.</p>

<p>By design, this app keeps your device <i>on</i> as long as the app is open and in-focus. This will drain your battery!</p>

<p>If you prefer, you can leave the app closed, and set it as your Exhibition app that launches when the screen turns off while the device is on the charger/Touchstone.</p>

<p>To get started, set your Home Page from the App Menu.</p>
